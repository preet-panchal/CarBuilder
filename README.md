Project: 
CarBuilder

Problem: 
If a client is looking to buy a car, to help them find their ideal car, we must build a car package that is tailored to our client. We know there are different car types (ie. Sedan, SUV, Minivan), but what if the client wants a specific make or colour for their car? 

We created a simple JavaFx application utilizing the Builder Design Pattern to solve the above problem. 

Instructions: 

1) Download project zip
2) Build gradle project in Intellj
3) Run "CarBuilderApp.java"
